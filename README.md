# ML Playground
This is a collection of smaller projects and some of the more interesting notebooks I've written over time as I learned ML. 
# Highlights
- A transformer written from scratch (and Tensorflow primitives)
- An application of machine learning to a possible data problem of a business
- Convolutional GANs on MNIST and other learning projects
